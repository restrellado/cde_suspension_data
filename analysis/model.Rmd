Suspension counts are unduplicated counts of students suspended. This means that if a student got supsended three times, they would only be counted once in the dataset. 

```{r}
total_sus <- school_sus %>% 
  filter(reporting_category == "Total")   # Total counts across all subgroups
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = total_sus, 
       aes(x = cumulative_enrollment, 
           y= unduplicated_count_of_students_suspended_total)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  labs(y = "Students suspended")
```

```{r}
fit <- lm(unduplicated_count_of_students_suspended_total ~ cumulative_enrollment, 
          data = total_sus)

summary(fit)
```
